  🌟 About

ChibiDevil is an experimental system service manager and init system designed as a modern alternative to systemd. Built on a microkernel architecture, ChibiDevil implements core functionality through modular services while maintaining a tiny, efficient core.

Current Status: Early conceptual phase (but the demon is waking up!)
🧠 Philosophy

    Microkernel design: Only essential functionality in the core

    Modular services: Everything else runs as managed services

    Simplicity: Clean, maintainable codebase

    Transparency: No magic - know exactly what's running

    Devilish efficiency: Small footprint, big capabilities

🏗 Planned Components
Component	Status	Description
Microkernel	💡	Core process management
Service Manager	💡	Lifecycle control for services
Journal	💡	Structured logging system
Device Manager	💡	Dynamic device handling
Network Manager	💡	Network configuration service
Login Manager	💡	User session management
🔥 Why ChibiDevil?

    No monolithic design - Components can be updated/replaced independently

    Better transparency - Clear service boundaries and interactions

    Small attack surface - Minimal core reduces vulnerability risks

    Customizable - Run only what you need

    Adorable mascot - Because sysdev should have personality!

🚧 Roadmap

    Core microkernel development

    Basic service manager

    Journal service implementation

    Device management module

    Network management service

    Integration testing

    Performance optimization

    World domination (highly recomended)

💻 Getting Started (Future)
bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chibidevil.git
cd chibidevil

# Build (when available)(TBD)
make && sudo make install

# Summon the demon (not yet)
sudo chibidevil --invoke

🤝 Contributing

When the project reaches a stage where contributions are welcome, we'll be looking for:

    Kernel developers (dante's best friend)

    Service module authors (brave enough to sell the soul(or to buy it))

    Documentation writers (with fast blood regeneration)

    Testers (brave enough to dance with the devil)

(Check back later for contribution guidelines!)
📜 License

ChibiDevil will be released under an open-source license (TBD). The demon belongs to everyone!
